Pre requisite:
Makefile - needs modification(CFLAGS and LFLAGS) depending on the development environment installation 
appid.txt - Fill in with the app KEY from registering api.openweathermap.org website
Library used: jsoncpp, zmq, curl and pthread


Running the program
invoking 
./server - preferable as bg process

./client  <message_code> <parameters>
./client 1 <cityid>
         2 <longitude> <latitude>
         3 <cityname>
